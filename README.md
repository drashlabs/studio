Having worked with Lnux (Debian) for over 5 years, I can comfortable assume you have formated your machine more than
3 times already.

## History

This project started when I kept going into my weekly holes. I usually formated my machine after a month after I did
a couple of digs.

My setup may not work for you plus I am always messing with the repo.
